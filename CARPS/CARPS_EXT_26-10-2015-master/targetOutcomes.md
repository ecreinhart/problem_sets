For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Inasmuch as our hypothesis was focused on concurrentretrieval processes that primarily affect SSRIF, weconducted separate repeated measures analyses of varianceto test for rehearsal effects and for SSRIF effects. Inthe analysis testing for a rehearsal effect, risk conditionwas a between-subjects variable, retrieval type (Rp+ vs.Nrp) was a within-subjects variable, and proportion ofexemplars recalled was the dependent variable. Wefound a significant main effect for retrieval type, F(1,458) = 119.25, p < .001, ηp2 = .21, but no significant maineffect for risk condition, F(1, 458) = 2.28, p = .13, ηp2 =.005, and no significant interaction between risk conditionand retrieval type, F(1, 458) = 0.11, p = .74, ηp2 =.001. In exploring the main effect for retrieval type, wefound a significant difference between recall of Rp+ items(M = .66, SD = .31) and recall of Nrp items (M = .52,SD = .25) in the low-risk condition, t(226) = 7.54, p <.001, d = 0.50, 95% CI for the difference between retrievaltypes = [.11, .19]. Similarly, in the high-risk condition,recall of Rp+ items (M = .69, SD = .30) was significantlyhigher than recall of Nrp items (M = .55, SD = .24),t(232) = 7.93, p < .001, d = 0.52, 95% CI for the differencebetween retrieval types = [.10, .17] (see Fig. 1). The magnitudeof the rehearsal effect was not significantly differentbetween the high-risk (M = .13, SD = .27) and thelow-risk (M = .15, SD = .30) conditions, t(458) = 0.33, p =.74, d = 0.04, 95% CI for the difference between conditions= [−.04, .07] (see Fig. 2).
