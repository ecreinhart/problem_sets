## Article ID: EXT_20-7-2015

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> The average number of valid training trials was 4.81 (seeTable S1 in the Supplemental Material). We analyzed thetotal looking times in different phases of the test trials.We found no significant difference between the trainedwordcondition and the untrained-word condition duringeither the 5-s first exposure phase, t(15) = 1.72, p = .106,d = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the lookingtimedifference = [–0.05, 0.46], or the 3-s response phase,t(15) = 1.52, p = .149, d = 0.38, 95% CI = [–0.04, 0.24].Figure 2a depicts the time course of changing preferenceduring the response phase. As expected, during thetest trials, the infants looked longer at the object that hadacted as the chaser when they heard the trained wordthan when they heard the untrained word. This was truefor all three predefined time ranges within the responsephase—0–1 s: t(15) = 5.73, p < .001, d = 1.43, 95% CI =[0.66, 1.00]; 0–2 s: t(15) = 3.23, p = .006, d = 0.81, 95%CI = [0.13, 0.62]; 0–3 s: t(15) = 2.47, p = .026, d = 0.62,95% CI = [0.04, 0.53] (see Fig. 2a). These effects remainedsignificant when looking-time differences during the firstexposure phase were included as covariates in the analyses,p < .001, p = .018, and p = .037, respectively, for thethree time ranges. Such differences were not due tochance: Using permutation-based t tests, we found thatthe difference scores in the trained-word condition andthe untrained-word condition were significantly differentfrom 0.33 to 2.06 s (ps < .050).In further analyses, we found that the difference scoresfor all three time ranges were significantly above thechance level in the trained-word condition—0–1 s: t(15) =5.88, p < .001, d = 1.47, 95% CI = [0.45, 0.96]; 0–2 s:t(15) = 2.59, p = .021, d = 0.65, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.45];0–3 s: t(15) = 2.84, p = .012, d = 0.71, 95% CI = [0.06,0.43]. This finding suggests that the infants identified thechaser as the referent of the trained word. Although thesame analysis did not reveal a significant difference fromzero in the untrained-word condition, an initial tendencyto look longer at the target was observed—0–1 s: t(15) =1.91, p = .075, d = 0.48, 95% CI = [–0.76, 0.04]; 0–2 s:t(15) = 0.93, p = .368, d = 0.23, 95% CI = [–0.43, 0.17];0–3 s: t(15) = 0.29, p = .774, d = 0.07, 95% CI = [–0.26,0.20].
